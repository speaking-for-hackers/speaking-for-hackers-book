*Your prime directive*

If you learn just one thing about public speaking, let it be this: your prime
directive as a presenter is Don't Be Boring.

Most speakers think that their topic is the most important part of their talk,
but they're wrong. And I'll prove it with a story.

A few days ago I was at a conference for students featuring introductory talks
on a number of topics. Nick Quaranto gave a talk on TDD. I've been doing TDD
for years now, have read about it in depth, and have discussed the practice to
death with lots of smart folks. I'm am extremely familiar with the topic.

Nick's talk was intended for folks that had never heard of TDD before, and was
completely basic. I learned literally (literally!) nothing from it.

And you know what? I was completely entertained for the whole damn thing.

Nick had well-designed slides, hilarious gifs, and excellent pacing and energy.
I laughed my way through his talk and gave him the hearty applause he deserved.
I didn't learn a thing from him, but he *made the concept interesting through
his delivery*.

THAT is what you should be shooting for when you stand up in front of a group
of people.

What you talk about is a trillion times less important than the way you present
it. Never forget that.

===============================================================================

*Keeping your audience's attention*

Remember your prime directive: don't be boring!

Start your talk with energy and passion. Show excitement over your topic and
try to convince your audience to share that excitement.

As your talk continues, realize that you'll have to work continuously to hold
their attention. Plan in jokes, surprises, or other emotional events. Jump off
the podium and stride out into the audience. Shout something. Admit an
embarassing truth. Turn the projector off. Anything that breaks up the monotony
and gets them to tune in again.

One great technique for holding interest is making your talk highly
interactive. Interactive talks are more interesting than lectures. I start
almost all my talks by saying "The point of this talk is not for me to reach
the end of of it. The point is for me to teach you something. So if I lose you
at any point, interrupt me immediately. I love questions." I tend to get a lot
of questions, which is great. People usually comment positively on how
interactive my session felt. Further, no one tunes out faster than someone who
doesn't understand what you're talking about. Encouraging questions gives you
the chance to not lose that person.

Remember: an audience's attention must be constantly maintained with energy and
interesting content.

===============================================================================

*Handling Questions*

If you follow my advice in the "Keeping your audience's attention" section,
you're likely to get questions during your talk.

Some speakers fear questions. They worry they'll disrupt their rehearsed
routine. The solution to this is the same thing that fixes most speaker
concerns: practice more.

When you get questions, it's important to do two things:

1. Repeat the question. Unless the venue is tiny or the asker is amplified,
repeat the question so you're sure the audience knows what you're answering.
Lots of speakers forget this--remembering will make you seem that much more
professional.

2. Respond graciously. Keep in mind that other people with questions are
watching to see how you treat the asker. I try to respond in the friendliest
way possible, even to challenging or somewhat antagonistic questions. I'll
often compliment the person with "great question", or thank them for asking it.

One other trick I've used to encourage questions is outright bribing. I'll
bring couple cool t-shirts and explain that I'll distribute them for great
questions. This usually works extremely well.

One final note: if you're in the middle of an important point you want to make,
don't be afraid to acknowledge someone with their hand up by saying "just one
sec on the question". You can also acknowledge them non-verbally with eye
contact and holding up one finger. Don't let questions interrupt an important
or dramatic moment in your talk.

===============================================================================

*Body Language*

The pressure of the stage causes many of us to do odd things with our bodies.

I watched a talk recently where the speaker betrayed his nervousness by
constantly fiddling with his badege (which he should have removed before
speakiny anyway).

Early in my speaking career, the discomfort of speaking caused me to talk for
long periods of time with my eyes closed. Others often seem to not know what to
do with their hands. Bad body language interferes with your talk. It can
broadcast discomfort or nervousness.

Fortunately, having good body language while speaking is a simple affair: it
mostly comes down to what to do with your hands. You have two options: down
straight at your sides; or with your elbows bent around 100 degrees, gesturing
naturally with palms up.

Nearly all other configurations with your arms can send messages you don't
want, with one exception. When taking questions, feel free to place your hands
behind your back and lean slightly forward. This is a listening posture and
shows attentiveness toward your questioner.

Beyond your hands, remember to stand tall and look confident the moment you
take the stage. Fake it 'til you make it applies here big-time.

===============================================================================

*Stage Movement Tricks*

A few recommendations for moving around on stage:

1. Do it, some. If you're using slides, you absolutely must have a remote slide
advancer. Moving around a bit on stage makes your talk more dynamic, and keeps
interest. I heartily recommend the Logitech E300 (***double-check model
number***).

2. Don't do it too much, it diminishes the effect.

3. For important points, walk toward your audience a bit (I like to go out
almost into the aisle), and STOP. Hold still while you make your important
point, then resume moving. This adds excellent emphasis.

4. When you recieve a good question, take a step or two toward your listener.
This shows encouragement. If you get an antagonistic question, you can achieve
the opposite effect by taking a step backwards.

===============================================================================

*Handling Nervousness*

I have three tricks for handling nervousness:

1. Prepare like crazy. The more I practice a talk, the less nervous I
get. There is no substitute for the confidence attained by
practicing your talk in close-to-real conditions a dozen times.

2. Accept it. Even when I'm extremely prepared and have no fear of
disaster, I still get a boost of adrenaline as I take the stage.
I've come to expect it, and now embrace it as a bonus--once I
complete my talk I still feel high for hours.

3. Beta-blockers. I've never used these for conference talks, but I
have for important singing gigs. Beta-blockers are a kind of miracle
drug for handling nerves. They don't sedate you at all, but simply
block your body's physical reactions to nervousness, like rapid
heartbeat, sweaty palms, shallow breathing, or drymouth. I've never
experieneced any side effects, and doctors seem to prescribe them
happily. If you have extreme anxiety about an upcoming talk,
consider them.

===============================================================================

*Things Not To Say*

As an audience member, I cringe every time I hear any of the
following:

1. "I'm not sure how much I'll get through of this..." You're not
sure because you didn't practice enough. Nothing makes me want to
leave a talk faster.

2. "Does anyone not know what foo is?" This is the worst way to see if
you need to explain something. No one likes admitting ignorance in
front of a group. If you must ask, say "who here is familiar with
foo?" If not every hand goes up, give a quick explanation.

3. "Hopefully you guys can read this in the back." Another line that
makes me want to leave immediately. You should always design your
talks to be extremely readable. You should also arrange with the
conference organizers to arrive early, plug in to the projector, and
check readability from the back of the room. Ensuring everyone can see
your slides/code/demo before your talk is YOUR resposibility.

4. "How much time do I have?" Most good venues/organizers will have a
timer that you can see from the stage, but don't count on it. I
often use my phone (don't forget to tell it not to auto-lock). When
presenting with slides, the Logitech E300 (*** check model number ***)
has a built-in timer that I can check discreetly that also vibrates at
the 5 and 2-minute marks.
