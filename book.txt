*Your prime directive*

If you learn just one thing about public speaking, let it be this: your prime directive as a presenter is Don't Be Boring.

Most speakers think that their topic is the most important part of their talk, but they're wrong. And I'll prove it with a story.

A few days ago I was at a conference for students featuring introductory talks on a number of topics. Nick Quaranto gave a talk on TDD. I've been doing TDD for years now, have read about it in depth, and have discussed the practice to death with lots of smart folks. I'm am extremely familiar with the topic.

Nick's talk was intended for folks that had never heard of TDD before, and was completely basic. I learned literally (literally!) nothing from it.

And you know what? I was completely entertained for the whole damn thing.

Nick had well-designed slides, hilarious gifs, and excellent pacing and energy. I laughed my way through his talk and gave him the hearty applause he deserved. I didn't learn a thing from him, but he *made the concept interesting through his delivery*.

THAT is what you should be shooting for when you stand up in front of a group of people. 

What you talk about is a trillion times less important than the way you present it. Never forget that.

=========================================================================================

*How to lay out your talk*

1. Introduction. Spend ONE sentence on this. People are very good at detecting if you know what you're talking about. If you do, your credentials don't matter. And if you don't...well, they don't matter then either.

2. Your main thesis. After you introduce yourself with one sentence, you should immediately hit the audience with your most important point. Always strive to front-load your talks with the most important stuff up front. Realize that 5% of your audience will tune out every minute you speak so make sure you start with the good stuff.

3. A quick mention of the structure of your talk. People like knowing where they are in your presentation, so give them a set of landmarks that they can recognize later: "I'm going to show you a few simple examples in the browser, and then we'll dig into the code behind it, and I'll end with some recommendations for further reading."

=========================================================================================

*Practicing Your Talk*

Practice talk in as close to live conditions as possible. Every variable that is different between your practicing and actual talk presents risk. 

One thing many speakers is that the resolution on their screen will be much lower than usual when plugged into a projector. It's an extremely good idea to drop your resolution to around 800x600 and run your entire talk. You'll be surprised at how many things you'll have to tweak. 

=========================================================================================

*Keeping your audience's attention*

Don't be boring!

They'll be excited if you seem excited.

Ask for a show of hands or for people to call out the answer to something.

Realize that you'll lose them about 8 minutes in and plan something surprising.

An audience's attention must constantly maintained with energy and interesting content.

=========================================================================================

*Pre-talk checklist*

Whenever I'm creating and practicing a talk, I start a section at the top of my notes file containing the steps needed to prepare my machine to give the talk. It's very easy to forget something small that will cause your demo to blow up, so don't leave this to chance. You DON'T want to try to remember these things when you're five minutes from taking the stage. 

Right before my talks I'm always a bit nervous, but running through my preparation checklist a few times gives me confidence that nothing will surprise me later.

Here are a few things that are in almost all my checklists:
  * clear browser history
  * clear browser autofill
  * hide browser bookmarks bar
  * bump up text size in browser
  * clean up desktop
  * invert colors for readability (Ctrl+Alt+Command+8 on OS X)
  * bump up text size in editor
  * print out notes
  * remember to bring DVI/VGA-to-DisplayPort adapter if you own a Mac
  * get excited!
