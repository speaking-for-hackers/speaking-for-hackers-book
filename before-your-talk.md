# Choosing a talk topic

Some potential speakers get blocked at the earliest stage: deciding what they
should talk about.

Here are a few guidelines for choosing a topic that has the possibility of
turning into a good talk.

### 1. Pick a topic in which you have deep expertise.

Particularly when you're getting started, your best bet is to start with
something that you know inside out.

The first talk I ever gave was on vim, a text editor I'd been using for five
years nearly every day. I'd seen my coworkers using it far less efficiently and
figured that if they needed some pointers, other developers would too.

Writing the outline for that talk was a breeze, because I'd built up so much
useful knowledge about the topic over the years. And when I eventually gave the
talk, I was confident I could handle any questions from the audience.

### 2. Pick something you rant about.

Counter-intuitively, you can give a successful talk about something you hate.

Most organizers like to have a little excitement in the schedule. Since most
talks are about why technology X is great and should be used, one that says the
opposite about technology Y can be a nice change of pace. Picking a fight can
get your proposal noticed.

One caveat: if you convince your audience something sucks, the first they'll
want to know is what they should do instead. Make sure you spend the bulk of
your talk time on this.

### 3. Pick something you know nothing about.

For the longest time, I wanted to learn Haskell and Erlang, but had never found
the time.

When my talk "What Rubyists should steal from Haskell and Erlang" got accepted,
I finally had the motivation I needed to really dig into these languages.

This tactic is more risky than the previous two, so it's probably best to only
consider it if you're an experienced speaker. (And, if I'm being honest, the
talk I described above didn't turn into one of my best.)

### 4. Ask your colleagues what they've learned from you.

Sometimes it's hard to tell that you know something that would be useful to others.

Before publishing my most popular blog post to date, I asked in Campfire "doesn't
everybody know this already?". It can be hard to remember what it's like to be
a beginner, and what kind of things you didn't know. It's also easy to discount
your own expertise (Dunning-Kruger anyone?).

One good hack around these challenges is to ask your co-workers what they've
learned from you. You might be surprised. Marvel for a minute, and then mine
that stuff for a new talk idea!


# Proposing Successfully

### 1. Keep it short and punchy.

Most conferences get over a hundred proposals. Put yourself in the shoes of an
organizer who has read 30 abstracts before yours, and wants to do 10 more
before he stops for the day. Think of it as speed dating: you've got 5 minutes
to pique his interest and get him wanting to hear more. Remember that your
proposal should make the reader want to see your talk.

### 2. Include social proof.

When you give your talks, look for feedback on Twitter (and solicit some if
there isn't any). Save links to the good stuff and include them in your
proposal (quote, plus a link to the original; the link is important). This
technique has two substantial benefits. First, it assuages an organizer's
concern that he's going to pick a bad speaker. It makes his life easier, which
is extremely good for you. Second, since not a lot of speakers will do this, it
will make you stand out from the crowd.

### 3. Titles matter.

Shoot for intriguing and memorable, in that order. Come up with a couple
candidates for your title and get input from friends. Which talk would YOU
rather hear?

### 4. Have a good bio.

Do cool stuff and talk about it.

### 5. Work hard to stand out.

At the very least, reach out to the organizers with a friendly email after
submitting. Tell them you're excited about their conference and that you'd love
to speak.

However, since you're trying to stand out from the other submitters, try to be
extra creative.

For my first talk, I really wanted to speak at RailsConf, a fairly competitive
venue. Since I had no track record of successful talks, I was asking the
organizers to simply trust that I was going to do a good job. That's a pretty
big risk for people who really care about the quality of their conference.

To allay this fear, I wrote up the first two minutes of my talk, and recorded a
video of me giving it to my empty office. After a dozen takes or so, I had
something I was proud of. I threw it on youtube, and sent a link to the
organizers with a heartfelt note expressing my interest in speaking. (Wanna
watch the video? Here's the private link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg33EQCdMxw)

To my amazement, the reply that came back was from Chad Fowler, a massive
figure in my field. 

His response was the following:

"Thanks for your email, your proposal and the video!  I LOVE what you've done
with the video especially :)

We're still working on the program obviously (given that the CFP hasn't closed
yet) but we'll definitely give yours an extra-special-close look."

Could I have asked for a better response? No way.

All that, because I was willing to take an extra hour of work into the proposal
process.

I got accepted, by the way.

More recently, I decided I really wanted to speak at RailsBerry, a conference
in Krakow whose website and CFP made it look like an amazing experience. To up
my chances, I sent a hand-written note on thoughtbot stationary to the
organizers (and even threw in some stickers as bribery). 

At the FedEx store, I realized that unless I overnighted the package, it
wouldn't arrive before they did the first round of talk selections. Standing
there, I realized I wanted this badly enough, gritted my teeth, and paid the
$120 in postage.

Another acceptance. This time to the most quirky, personality-filled, and
well-executed conference I've ever attended. Worth every penny.


# An example proposal

Here's a proposal I submitted recently. It was accepted at NordicRuby in 2012,
which took only 12 talks from a pool of 113.

<dl><dd><em>Title</em>: What Rubyists should Steal from Haskell and Clojure</dd>

<dd><em>Abstract</em>: Ruby is a great little language, but that doesn't mean it got
everything right.  This talk will be a tour of the best features from Clojure
and Haskell that you can't find in Ruby. The goal isn't to try to convert you
to these languages, but to expand your knowledge of the best ideas in
programming language design.  We'll also see how understanding the rationale
behind these features can help you write better Ruby.</dd>

<dd>If concepts like anaphora, destructuring binds, and monads aren't familiar to
you, prepare to learn some powerful concepts. And don't worry: this won't be
some voice-from-the-clouds, ivory tower tutorial. Just a pragmatic guy teaching
cool ideas with simple examples. No neckbeard required.</dd></dl>

Notes to organizers: (Here's where I gush about their conference a litle.)

Then, I include the following quotes, gathered after my most-recent talk:

<dl><em><dd>"@r00k you're one of the best presentors I've ever seen in tech."
https://twitter.com/#!/sayhar/status/165851089860702208</dd>

<dd>"@r00k and what a presentation it was. i wish you were my public speaking
professor." https://twitter.com/#!/tony_ciampa/status/165954726695944193</dd>

<dd>"@r00k is killing - calisthenics, comedy, hecklers, and great super-fast coding
w/ vim" https://twitter.com/#!/pattytoland/status/165849474747469824</dd></em>

<dd><em>Bio</em>: Ben has spoken in several countries and in multiple languages, in venues
varying from tiny conference rooms to giant lecture halls.</dd>

<dd>He is the co-founder of the Boston Vim Meetup, creator of vimuniversity.com,

<dd>When not demanding that everyone remap caps lock to escape, Ben writes code at
thoughtbot, occasionally correctly.</dd></dl>


# Kill Your Introduction

After attending many conferences and dozens of talks, I've noticed a disturbing
trend among speakers: most of them start with an introduction.

Their first slide has the title of the talk.

Their second slide states their name and employer.

Their third slide covers what the talk is about. This is usually the same
abstract that's been published for months on the conference site.

Their fourth slide is usually some sort of back-story like who invented the
concept they'll be talking about, or a survey of the landscape around their
topic.

Finally, around slide number five and minute six, they begin to teach the
audience something of value. If you forced them to stop after five minutes and
ask the audience what useful things they've learned so far, they would have
virtually no answer.

My advice to conference speakers is this: kill your introduction.

I start nearly all my talks like this: "My name is Ben Orenstein and I work for
thoughtbot. This talk is about why vim is the greatest text editor ever
written. The most important thing for you to take away from this talk is X."

One sentence intro. One sentence summary. Third sentence is the most important
idea of the talk.

If you stopped one of my talks after five minutes, my audience would have
learned four minutes and fifty-five seconds of useful information. And they
certainly would have already heard the main thesis of my talk.

There are two reasons I structure my talks this way:

1. There is no need to establish yourself as an authority. People tend to be
very good at detecting competence. If you have impressive credentials but don't
seem to know what you're talking about, you'll lose credibility rapidly.
Likewise, if you are clearly an expert on your topic your credentials are
irrelevant. Make sure you know your subject matter cold, and trust people to
spot your expertise.

2. The number of people listening to you over time steadily declines with time.
However, for the first minute or so you'll have nearly everyones' attention.
Don't waste this opportunity! Hit them with your most important ideas
immediately so that when they do tune out they're missing less and less
important information. As a bonus, by being immediately useful and interesting,
the slope of your tune-out graph will be shallower.

Journalists are trained to front-load their articles so that an editor can chop
any amount off the end and still have a usable piece. Think of your talks this
way and your audiences will thank you.


# Practicing Your Talk

Practice talk in as close to live conditions as possible. Every variable that
is different between your practicing and actual talk presents risk. 

One thing many speakers forget is that the resolution on their screen will be much
lower than usual when plugged into a projector. It's an extremely good idea to
drop your resolution to around 800x600 and run your entire talk. You'll be
surprised at how many things you'll have to tweak. 

Additionally, virtually all talks are subject to a time constraint. DO NOT go
over your time allotment! It is immensely disrespectful to your audience in two
ways. First, it says that you didn't care enough to practice to make sure you
came in under time. Second, it shows a lack of concern for the rest of your
audience's day. So don't just estimate and hope. Practice with a timer and make
sure you're in good shape. 

By the way, if you find yourself rushing skipping slides and saying "I'm just
gonna skip over this because we're short on time" you've blown it. If that
material wasn't important, why was it in your talk? And if it is important,
your lack of practice just made you dump something that you should have
covered.

Note: most talks run long. It's rare for speakers to finish early. Recognize
this and err on finishing early. This will just mean an extended Q&A and/or an
early finish for your audience, which usually feels like getting out of class a
bit ahead-of-schedule.


# On Slides

I've given around dozen talks in the last couple years, and I've noticed a
definite trend: when I use slides, people like my talks. When I do live coding,
they love them.

I've noticed this as an audience member as well. I've seen far too many talks
that could easily have been a long-ish blog post; something I could read in
about 10 minutes. This begs the question: what have I gained by watching you
recite it more slowly? Great delivery can add quite a bit, but by definition,
most speakers are fairly average at it.

The problem with static content is that it's static. It's faster to simply read
it.

This isn't so with live coding or demos. You're more likely to understand a
refactoring if I show you how to do it. You're more likely to grasp how a tool
works when I work through some examples in a REPL. In this case, a narrative
description would be harder to parse.

Consider this: when discussing theoretical code ideas with co-workers, someone
will frequently say "just show me what you're talking about". Once both parties
are around the same screen looking at real code, clarity is quickly achieved.

Now imagine you're reading a technical blog post.  Have you ever said to
yourself "I wish someone would break this idea into bullet points and throw
them on some slides"?

Another reason to prefer live demos is that they've more information-dense.
Whenever I do live coding, people tell me they learned a new vim trick, or a
novel way of accomplishing something in the shell. Watching someone at work
teaches you far more than simply gazing at the frozen final product.

Finally, you should prefer doing things live because it keeps peoples'
attention better. Everyone knows live-coding carries some risk, so they're a
bit on edge waiting to see if you can handle it. You earn immediate respect by
showing you're gutsy enough to try it, and huge kudos if you can pull it off. 

The risk of live coding scares many speakers off, but you shouldn't let it
intimidate you. Yes, these talks take more time to prepare, and carry a bit
more risk of failure, but the payoff is tremendous. Start small, with a
lightning talk, perhaps. Figure out the level of preparation you need to feel
confident. Then go for it in longer talk slots.


# Pre-talk checklist

Whenever I'm creating and practicing a talk, I start a section at the top of my
notes file containing the steps needed to prepare my machine to give the talk.
It's very easy to forget something small that will cause your demo to blow up,
so don't leave this to chance. You DON'T want to try to remember these things
when you're five minutes from taking the stage. 

Right before my talks I'm always a bit nervous, but running through my
preparation checklist a few times gives me confidence that nothing will
surprise me later.

Here are a few things that are in almost all my checklists:
  * clear browser history 
  * clear browser autofill 
  * hide browser bookmarks bar
  * bump up text size in browser 
  * clean stray icons off your desktop 
  * invert colors for readability (Ctrl+Alt+Command+8 on OS X) 
  * bump up text size in editor 
  * print out notes
  * remember to bring DVI/VGA-to-DisplayPort adapter if you own a Mac
  * change energy settings so your laptop won't sleep
  * remove the clock and battery meter from your status bar
  * get excited!


# You don't (really) have to cover what you promised

Imagine you propose an awesome talk idea and it gets accepted.

Later, when actually trying to create it, you realize your idea doesn't work so
well in the harsh light of the projector. Perhaps you don't have nearly enough
material to cover. More likely, your proposal has bitten off far more than you
can chew in forty minutes. What can you do?

Fortunately, you're not really in a tough spot.

First of all, no one expects you to deliver exactly the talk you promise in
your proposal. You've got some wiggle room if you want to cover (or cut) things
in a way that doesn't match your original description.

This works fine if you need to make minor changes to your talk, but what if
you've got deeper issues? What can you do if there's just no way this talk is
going to work?

Even here, you still have an out. I've contacted organizers on three different
occasions asking for if I can change my topic, and all have granted it without
complaint. Even when the new talk was wildly different (from a soft-skills talk
to full-on live-coding, for example). My theory is that once you're through the
selection process, the organizers are confident you will deliver *something* of
quality, and are willing to trust you.

Even so, if you do ask to change topics, don't forget a little salesmanship for
the new talk you're swapping in. Set them at ease by conveying that this
substitute talk will be as good or better as the one they originally accepted.


# Prepare yourself for doubt

As your talk approaches, it's totally normal to feel greater and greater doubts
about how it's going to go.

I've told myself all of the following before a talk:

"This is obvious to everyone." 
"I feel like a fraud."
"There are no new ideas here." 
"My friends are going to think I suck."

Despite these doubts, I've usually gone on to give a satisfyingly-successful
talk.

These days, I just expect these thoughts to pop into my head before a talk, and
to be worst just before going on stage. It's still no fun that it happens, but
now I'm mentally prepared and shrug it off.

When I talk to other speakers, they often admit to having the same thoughts.
Don't freak out if you do too.


# Organize Up

There's a saying in the business world that great employees think about
"managing up", which means helping your manager be good at his or her job. What
better way to seem indispensable?

Turns out this is a great idea with conference organizers too: make it easy for
them to set up your talk perfectly.

My live-coding talks require both hands, so I really need a lav mike. A mike
mounted on the podium doesn't let me bound to the edge of the stage for
important points. Most conferences will have lav mikes, but I've started mentioning
it in my proposals to be sure.

It's also a great idea to ask what resolution the projector will be running. Most
organizers won't email this out unless asked. Asking makes it likely that they'll
just email all the speakers abou it. Maybe other people will discover avoidable 
issues.
