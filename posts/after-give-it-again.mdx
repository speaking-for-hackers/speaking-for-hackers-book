You can give the exact same talk many times. It's fine.

In fact, the best way to make a talk truly excellent is to give it live several times. This also helps build your reputation as "the X guy/gal" (where X is your talk's topic).

Don't worry about people in the audience already having seen your talk. I've had folks tell me they still found it rather valuable to watch a talk a second time.
